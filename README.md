## Dashing config for documentation generated by rust/cargo

The [dashing.json](./dashing.json) contains a sample file for generating a docset via [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing).

### Usage

- Generate the cargo documentation for the crate via `cargo doc`
- Copy `dashing.json` to a place of your choosing
- Adjust the values in `dashing.json` to fit your crate (the example `dashing.json` is for the `iron` crate).
- Run `dashing` and point it at the generated doc directory: e.g. `dashing build target/doc/iron`
- Add the generated docset to your docset viewer


#### Alternatives

For an alternative approach for generating docsets for crates take a look at [rsdocs2docset](https://github.com/kesselborn/rsdocs2docset).
